                                Hello, my name is Joel Smith and I am a software developer. Ever since my introduction
                                to programming at the age of 12, I have been fascinated with software and technology.
                                I enjoy solving problems and making life easier through code. Whether it's building a
                                back-end API or developing an intuitive website, I enjoy the process of creating beneficial
                                software.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some of my favorite programming languages and technologies that I have been recently working
                                with include Java, TypeScript, and Angular. Besides programming, I enjoy researching and getting
                                involved in Cryptocurrency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Actively, I am seeking an opportunity to not only gain hands-on experience in the software industry
                                and expand upon my technical skillset, but to also provide meaningful value to a development team.
                                Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss potential collaboration or job opportunities.
                            </p>
